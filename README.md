##Problem Statement
Financial Freedom in today's world seems  impossible if you don't have capital. However it can be achieved by investing mindfully in equity markets.

High brokerage of Brokers/Investment banks

##Solution
To ease the process of stock investment and make it possible for anyone to perform stock investment without the help of the middle man - 
Customer Segmentation using their personal data (Age, Income, Job, Education, Marital Status,  Housing and Loan)
Stock Prediction using index created of 5 stocks (from different industries) 
Portfolio Generation by iterating through different weights given to each stock
Matching portfolios with Maximum Utility for each Customer Segment
